## Hotel Booking System (Laravel 5.1)

This project is an example Laravel 5 open-source project from [here](http://learninglaravel.net/hotel-booking-engine-with-laravel-5-and-angularjs-part-1) where they explain how to create an hotel booking system from scratch using Laravel 5.1 and AngularJS. In the booking engine they used AngularJS to create a single page application, the front end, where the final user can make reservations and the hotel owner can manage rooms, price and reservations. On the backend side we will use Laravel to create all the needed REST API to serve the application.It will be a modular tutorial, so letâ€™s start by create the data model and some basic REST api to serve the frontend.
